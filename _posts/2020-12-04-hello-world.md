It's the begining. Begining of many things. Begining of new commitments and responsibilities. The feel of fresh air filling the lungs, the high definition view, and the warm in skin are like saying "prepare yourself to face the storm. No, it won't happen once. It'll always happen". Should I turn away? No, I don't think so. Let's face it. 

**Hello world!**
