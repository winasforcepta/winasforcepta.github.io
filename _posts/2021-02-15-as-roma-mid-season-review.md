They started the match pretty well until Ronaldo marked his name on the scoresheet in 13th minute, yet kept showing the right mentality by giving constant pressure to the enemy. I mean, it's Juve who they dominated at the whole first half. But, Roma was "being Roma", who always lost their focus on the last third. Wrapped up the match with Ibañez own goal, they made it clear that they have no intention to race for the title. Maybe champion league spot would be significant enough for the Friedkiens in their first year.

Despite the loss, I want to talk about the Romans performance throughout the half-season. In my view, the lads have been doing well so far. Considering the woes performance against top teams, 4th place is quite fantastic. 

So, What are my thoughts of this season AS Roma? Here are a couple of good and bad points that I spot.


## Strong Rooks

It's been a long time since I see Roma has strong defenders. Now, they have all they need. The extra front-men Gianluca Mancini and Roger Ibañez, and the recently acquired, Marash Kumbulla are settled nicely in the eternal city. Of course, no matter where we are, we always need a senior or two as a role model, and Smalling is covering the role nicely. 

But, they really need to work on the clumsy play. I mean, the Giallorossi doesn't have the Alisson anymore. So hey, at least don't make the goalkeeper's life harder, ok?

## Cristante Versatility

When we talk about Cristante, versatility is the first word that comes. Naturally plays as a centre midfielder, he has been playing various position, from the centre back until attacking midfielder. When he plays as a centre back, his accurate long pass effectively starts a deadly counter-attack. When he is pushed to a higher position, that's his favourite.

Indeed, he isn't Fonseca's first choice. But he has been there when the team need him. Kudos to the vice-captain!

## Speedy Flanks

Looking at the flanks, they have been playing vigorously. Looks like Roma is starting a lot of attacking from both wings, especially from the left one where Leonardo Spinazolla always dances (Unfortunately I couldn't find any data regarding this. If someone knows where to get this kind of data, do ping me). Their dribbling ability is opening the attack on many occasions, and their speed is handy to perform a counter-attack. Besides the attacking role, I feel that they are also playing the wing-back role, which fits perfectly in a three-back formation.

But it doesn't come cheap. Energy is the price. The Romans has only scored 38% goals and been conceded 72% goals in the second half <sup><a href="https://www.soccerstats.com/team.asp?league=italy&stats=4-as-roma" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>. Perhaps the lack of stamina plays a significant factor in why Roma has lost focus on the second half.
 
Thanks to the up to five substitution rule, Fonseca could play some substitution-tactic. Unfortunately, there is no sufficient backup so far. Santon and Calafiori are rarely available, and Bruno Peres couldn't offer the same quality of service. Interesting to see how well is the latest signed wonder kid, Bryan Reynold, is settled in the capital city.

## Dull Attackers

Dull, harmless, slow, sluggish, ineffective, you name it. Those are the words that perfectly represent the Roman attackers. Furthermore, with only two pure strikers, Roma desperately needs more attacking reinforcement. Fatigue and injury are definitely haunting. Especially when you don't have any backup.

The recent Džeko - Fonseca clash is worsening. Looks like Pinto has successfully solved the problem. But... did he? Honestly, I don't expect high ambition anymore from the Bosnian talisman. Perhaps finding him a new employer with a low price would be the best option. It would free up the €5 million salary tho.

The next question is, who would be the best to replace? Indeed Mayoral is an excellent option. But he is still too young for the starting lineup. Although, I'm confident he will be ready soon in 2-3 seasons. Then who? Chiesa di Totti has been linking Torino's captain, Andrea Belotti for years <sup><a href="https://www.chiesaditotti.com/as-roma-transfer-news-rumors/2021/1/29/22254866/roma-jovic-kean-strikers-transfers" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>. The bomber has €40 million price tag, and his €3 million wages<sup><a href="https://salarysport.com/football/player/andrea-belotti/" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup> should fit perfectly in the club's budget. My personal favourite goes to Hertha Berlin's striker, Krzysztof Piątek. Looking at his market value, which has been plunged (surprisingly) to €17 million<sup><a href="https://www.transfermarkt.com/krzysztof-piatek/marktwertverlauf/spieler/327757#:~:text=at%20Hertha%20BSC.-,With%20a%20market%20value%20of%20%E2%82%AC21.50m%2C%20Krzysztof%20Piatek,among%20all%20players%20born%201995." target="_blank">[4]</a></sup>, may allow Roma to add the third option on the attacking side, perhaps with a hybrid striker-midfielder role like Henrikh Mkhitaryan does.

## The Friedkin's Reformation (?)

The Friedkin group acquisition in August 2020 was a piece of good news to me. Their strong portfolio gives me the hope that they could tidy up the Stadio Della Roma project mess and make smart investments like pro businessmen do. I personally like their management style. Looks like they are not in a rush to reform the club structure rather carefully. Like when they hired Tiago Pinto as the new General Manager and leaving the traditional sporting director role. His decision to let Fonseca does his job despite the crisis despite some rumours says Fonseca's seat was warmed up was a right one in my view. I also get the sense of seriousness from them to build this club. I mean, they have a lot of business to do, yet they have been showing up on (maybe) every match. So, fingers crossed!

## Final Thought

To summarize, the lads have been doing well so far. Playing a realistic strategy by capitalizing games against non-first-segment teams is a wise choice when you know your own level. But, they should level up everything as a club. They need to keep the supporters happy to keep the business running. Let's see how the season will go in the second half. Forza Roma!
